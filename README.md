Project Overview:
This project aims to develop a RESTful API server for a smart home using Python, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL. 
The server will provide endpoints for managing devices, sensors, actuators in the smart home, and the interface which user uses to configure smarthouse system. 

Project Goals:
1) Develop a secure and scalable RESTful API server using FastAPI
2) Integrate PostgreSQL database to store device, sensor, and actuator data
3) Provide endpoints for managing devices, sensors, and actuators

Project Success Metrics:
1) Robustness and scalability of the API server
2) Accuracy and reliability of data
3) User satisfaction with the overall smart home experience
